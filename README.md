## Overview
By creating an analysis of the CitiBike usage in NYC a proposal can be made to show possible investors to support the bike-sharing service in another city like Des Moines, Iowa. Visualizations on Tableu were made given a dataset from CitiBikes own website.

## Summary
After compiling the analysis we can deduct that the majority of the users will be locals or the working demographic as opposed to the tourists since peak hours are at 8 am and 5 pm. Most of the users tend to be males and customers instead of subscribers to the service. Most users commuted for short periods of time. For a bike-sharing service to start in Des Moines, ads would do better to target the male demographic and the working demographic. Since Des Moines is not as congested as NYC, bike stations should mostly be in the most populous areas.
